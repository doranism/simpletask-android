# DRAG_NEG_Y

`static val DRAG_NEG_Y: `[`Int`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html)

Drag flag bit. Floating View can move in the negative y direction. This is subtle. What this actually means is that the floating View can be dragged above its starting position. Remove in favor of lower-bounding item position?
