### Types

| Name | Summary |
|---|---|
| [DragSortController](-drag-sort-controller/index.md) | `open class DragSortController : `[`SimpleFloatViewManager`](-simple-float-view-manager/index.md)`, OnTouchListener, OnGestureListener`<br>Class that starts and stops item drags on a DragSortListView based on touch gestures. This class also inherits from SimpleFloatViewManager, which provides basic float View creation. An instance of this class is meant to be passed to the methods DragSortListView#setTouchListener() and DragSortListView#setFloatViewManager() of your DragSortListView instance. |
| [DragSortCursorAdapter](-drag-sort-cursor-adapter/index.md) | `abstract class DragSortCursorAdapter : CursorAdapter, `[`DragSortListener`](-drag-sort-list-view/-drag-sort-listener.md)<br>A subclass of android.widget.CursorAdapter that provides reordering of the elements in the Cursor based on completed drag-sort operations. The reordering is a simple mapping of list positions into Cursor positions (the Cursor is unchanged). To persist changes made by drag-sorts, one can retrieve the mapping with the ``[`#getCursorPositions()`](-drag-sort-cursor-adapter/get-cursor-positions.md) method, which returns the reordered list of Cursor positions. An instance of this class is passed to DragSortListView#setAdapter(ListAdapter) and, since this class implements the DragSortListView.DragSortListener interface, it is automatically set as the DragSortListener for the DragSortListView instance. |
| [DragSortItemView](-drag-sort-item-view/index.md) | `open class DragSortItemView : ViewGroup`<br>Lightweight ViewGroup that wraps list items obtained from user's ListAdapter. ItemView expects a single child that has a definite height (i.e. the child's layout height is not MATCH_PARENT). The width of ItemView will always match the width of its child (that is, the width MeasureSpec given to ItemView is passed directly to the child, and the ItemView measured width is set to the child's measured width). The height of ItemView can be anything; the The purpose of this class is to optimize slide shuffle animations. |
| [DragSortItemViewCheckable](-drag-sort-item-view-checkable/index.md) | `open class DragSortItemViewCheckable : `[`DragSortItemView`](-drag-sort-item-view/index.md)`, Checkable`<br>Lightweight ViewGroup that wraps list items obtained from user's ListAdapter. ItemView expects a single child that has a definite height (i.e. the child's layout height is not MATCH_PARENT). The width of ItemView will always match the width of its child (that is, the width MeasureSpec given to ItemView is passed directly to the child, and the ItemView measured width is set to the child's measured width). The height of ItemView can be anything; the The purpose of this class is to optimize slide shuffle animations. |
| [DragSortListView](-drag-sort-list-view/index.md) | `open class DragSortListView : ListView`<br>ListView subclass that mediates drag and drop resorting of items. |
| [ResourceDragSortCursorAdapter](-resource-drag-sort-cursor-adapter/index.md) | `abstract class ResourceDragSortCursorAdapter : `[`DragSortCursorAdapter`](-drag-sort-cursor-adapter/index.md)<br>Static library support version of the framework's android.widget.ResourceCursorAdapter. Used to write apps that run on platforms prior to Android 3.0. When running on Android 3.0 or above, this implementation is still used; it does not try to switch to the framework's implementation. See the framework SDK documentation for a class overview. |
| [SimpleDragSortCursorAdapter](-simple-drag-sort-cursor-adapter/index.md) | `open class SimpleDragSortCursorAdapter : `[`ResourceDragSortCursorAdapter`](-resource-drag-sort-cursor-adapter/index.md)<br>An easy adapter to map columns from a cursor to TextViews or ImageViews defined in an XML file. You can specify which columns you want, which views you want to display the columns, and the XML file that defines the appearance of these views. Binding occurs in two phases. First, if a android.widget.SimpleCursorAdapter.ViewBinder is available, ``[`ViewBinder#setViewValue(android.view.View, android.database.Cursor, int)`](#) is invoked. If the returned value is true, binding has occured. If the returned value is false and the view to bind is a TextView, ``[`#setViewText(TextView, String)`](#) is invoked. If the returned value is false and the view to bind is an ImageView, ``[`#setViewImage(ImageView, String)`](#) is invoked. If no appropriate binding can be found, an IllegalStateException is thrown. If this adapter is used with filtering, for instance in an android.widget.AutoCompleteTextView, you can use the android.widget.SimpleCursorAdapter.CursorToStringConverter and the android.widget.FilterQueryProvider interfaces to get control over the filtering process. You can refer to ``[`#convertToString(android.database.Cursor)`](-simple-drag-sort-cursor-adapter/convert-to-string.md) and ``[`#runQueryOnBackgroundThread(CharSequence)`](#) for more information. |
| [SimpleFloatViewManager](-simple-float-view-manager/index.md) | `open class SimpleFloatViewManager : `[`FloatViewManager`](-drag-sort-list-view/-float-view-manager/index.md)<br>Simple implementation of the FloatViewManager class. Uses list items as they appear in the ListView to create the floating View. |
